# AI Usage

As per the requirement, add AI usage if applicable.

## Upgrading gradle version

Used AGP upgrade assistance to update the necessary details when updating to gradle version 8.4.

## Validating ideas

We used AI to validate the idea of MVVM. If it is still considered MVVM if we used repository
and data source. Based on the research it is still considered as MVVM. 

We were hesitant if we will add repository and data source vs model only using data class.

But we just move forward on using repository and data source for to abstract away and for 
separation of concern.

We also did some advance research using AI to refresh on the idea about `capturing image` and 
saving it to a known path.


## AI Usage in PaymentRepository and Model
